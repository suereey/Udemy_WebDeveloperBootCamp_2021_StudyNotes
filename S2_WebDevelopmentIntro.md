# An Introduction to Web Development
## What matters in this seciton
- Crucial!
    - Install VScode and Chrome
    - Understanding the roles of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Important
    - How the internet work
    - HTTP Request/Response cycle
    - Intro to the web
- Nice to have
    - vscode theme

## Front end and Backend
- HTTP Request/Response cycle
    - input in google chrome (send the http request to google server)
    - google gives back (html, css, and js) the webpage
- Example in resturant:
    - Back end: people who cook
    - Front end: people who serve food to customer
- Back end: After the request is sent, back end **constructing the response**. 
    For example,after a request is send, google need to figure out: what are the researh result? How do I rank them? How many are theere? How many pages we need to make? Who is asking for this? have the permission? what about the ad?....
- Front end: the code it send runs in my browser (the client side or front end code: HTML, CSS, JS).

## What do HTML/CSS/JS do?
- HTML: the content of the page
- CSS: describes that structure and how it should look
- JS: building the acutal logic, the action, the verbs of the webpage
- Calculator example:
    - Only HTML: the number key, the reset key
    - HTML + CSS: KEY + format (looks better but no calculation)
